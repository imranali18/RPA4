   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

CS1100 Spring 2019 Python Installation Instructions
===================================================

Our first step is for each student to install Python 3.7, an
integrated development environment, and a cloud-based file back-up.
We will use Miniconda, Wing IDE 101 and Dropbox, each of which is
available to Windows, Mac OS X and Linux users.  You are allowed to
use other versions of these as long as you ` Python 3.7, but you
are strongly advised to use Miniconda and the Wing IDE 101.

Installing Python 3.7 Using Miniconda and Wing IDE 101
------------------------------------------------------

The Python 3.7 system of packages (the core language plus useful
Python software that other people have written and contributed) we
will use is called Anaconda.  This provides a powerful set of tools
for data analytics and you can eventually move toward using these if
you wish, but for now we will stick with a simple version called
Miniconda.

Dropbox
-------

We strongly encourage you to use "cloud backup" for your course files.
(A disk crash is not an acceptable excuse for a late homework.)  We
recommend Dropbox, but you can use any other cloud storage system
you'd like.  Dropbox works by creating a folder on your computer and
automatically replicating this folder - and any subfolders you
create - in the cloud. Therefore, the same files can be accessed on
your computer, or through a web browser.  They are automatically kept
in sync whenever your computer is on the internet.  In addition to
protecting your files in case of a disk crash, Dropbox is handy if
you'd like to work from a computer other than your own laptop (in,
say, the VCC or something).  Get start with Dropbox via:

    `https://www.dropbox.com/install <https://www.dropbox.com/install>`_

You will only need the free version for this course.

Finally, you'll be creating A LOT of files for this class, and they'll
be quite a pain to keep up with unless you organize them somehow.
Once you get Dropbox installed, go ahead and set up a file structure
like::

    Dropbox/cs1100/hw/ 
    Dropbox/cs1100/lab/
    Dropbox/cs1100/lecture/

etc. on your laptop. You'll thank yourself (and us) later.
