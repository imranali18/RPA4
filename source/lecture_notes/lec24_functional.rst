Lecture 24 â€” Advanced Python Topics and Functional Programming
===============================================================


Problems We Would Like to Solve
-------------------------------

Some of these are toy problems, but they illustrate the use of tools we would
like to develop and use:

#. How many values are in a list of lists?

#. What is the maximum distance from the origin of the points in a list?

#. What is the sum of squares of the first n integers?

#. Can you sum the positive values in a list?

#. Can you sort a list of points by y value (2nd coordinate) and then
   by x value?


Solution Techniques
-------------------

-  We can solve most of these with a ``for`` loop, but they can be
   solved even more effectively / efficiently / compactly using
   advanced Python methods.

-  Leads to notions of:

  - map and filter

  - functions as parameters

  - lambda functions

  - stable sort

  - list comprehensions

- Most are examples of *functional programming*.


Map: Apply a function to each element of a list
-----------------------------------------------

-  Suppose we want to count the number of values in a list of lists.
   We can use ``map`` to apply the :func:`len` function to each sublist:

   ::

     >>> v = [[2, 3, 5, 7], [11, 13, 17, 19], [23, 29], [31, 37]]
     >>> print(list(map(len, v)))
     [4, 4, 2, 2]

-  ``map`` is an *iterator* class:

   - It produces values in a sequence, one after another, by applying
     the function (1st argument) to the values of the second argument.

   - Technically, an iterator class is one that has the ``__next__``
     method implemented (correctly).

   - Using :func:`list` gives us the list of lengths of the sublists
     explicitly.

-  To complete the solution we need to just apply sum:

   ::

      >>> print(sum(map(len, v)))
      12

   Notice that this does not explicitly form an intermediate list.


Passing Functions as Parameters
-------------------------------

-  The above example passes the :func:`len` function as an argument!

   - We also passed functions as arguments to our callbacks in our GUI
     programs.

-  This illustrates the concept that Python treats function as
   "first-class" objects - in other words functions can be used just
   like variables and other data.

   - What's passed as an argument to :func:`map` is the location of
     the function code.

-  Now suppose we want to find the maximum distance of a list of points
   from the origin.  Here, we'll have to write a function:

   ::

      def dist2D(p):
          return (p[0]**2 + p[1]**2)**0.5

      pts = [(4.5, 3), (2.1, -1), (6.8, -3), (1.4, 2.9)]
      print(max(map(dist2D, pts)))


Lambda functions:  Anonymous functions
--------------------------------------

-  We can avoid the need to write a separate function here by writing an
   *anonymous* function called a *lambda* function.

-  Our first example is just squaring the values of a list:

   ::

     >>> list(map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
     [1, 4, 9, 16]

-  Now, we can sum the squares from 1 to n:

   ::

     >>> n = 100
     >>> sum(map(lambda x: x**2, range(1, n + 1)))

-  We can also implement the :func:`dist2D` function anonymously:

  ::

    >>> max(map(lambda p: (p[0]**2 + p[1]**2)**0.5, pts))
    7.432361670424818

-  Notice that we did not need to explicitly form a list in each of
   the preceding examples. This leads to substantial savings when
   the list is large!

-  Aside: the notion of a lambda function goes all the way back to
   the origin of computer science.



In-Class Practice Problem:
--------------------------

#. Starting with the following list of (x, y) point coordinate types, we
   will use :func:`map`, a lambda function, and :func:`max` to find the
   maximum x coordinate (the 0-th coordinate) in a list of points.

   ::

       pts = [(6, -1), (8, 4), (7.5, -3), (4.4, 12), (7, 2)]



Filter:  Extract / eliminate values from a list
-----------------------------------------------

- Consider a different problem:  how to eliminate all of the negative
  values from a list.  Based on what we know so far, this requires a
  ``for`` loop with :func:`append`.

- We can simplify this using the built-in Python construct
  called ``filter``:

  ::

    >>> v = [1, 9, -4, -8, 10, -3]
    >>> list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, v))
    [1, 9, 10]

- Here:
  
  -  The lambda function must produce a boolean value and if that
     value is ``True`` the list item is kept; otherwise it is
     eliminated. 

  -  The result of ``filter`` is an iterator object, just like the
     result of ``map`` is. We convert to a list in order to display
     the answer.

-  If we want to sum up the non-negative values, then we don't need to
   explicitly generate a list:

   ::

      >>> sum(filter(lambda x: x > 0, v))
      20
  

Lecture Exercises, Problems 1 and 2:
------------------------------------

-  At this point students will be given the chance to work on the
   first two lecture exercises.

Passing Functions to Sort
-------------------------

- Consider the problem of sorting a list of (x, y) points by their y
  values first and their x values for tied y values, both in
  decreasing order.  For example, given:

  ::

      pts = [(2, 5), (12, 3), (12, 1), (6, 5), (14, 10), (12, 10), \
                (8, 12), (5, 3)]

  we'd like the sorted order to be:

  ::

     [(8, 12), (14, 10), (12, 10), (6, 5), (2, 5), (12, 3), \
          (5, 3), (12, 1)]

-  The Python sort function:

   ::

      >>>  sorted(pts, reverse=True)
      [(14, 10), (12, 10), (12, 3), (12, 1), (8, 12), (6, 5), \
          (5, 3), (2, 5)]

   gives the ordering by x value and then by y value. This is not what
   we want.

-  The first step to a solution is to provide a *key* function to
   :func:`sorted` to pull out the information (the y value in this
   case) from each tuple to use as the basis for sorting:

   ::

      >>> sorted(pts, key=lambda p: p[1], reverse=True)
      [(8, 12), (14, 10), (12, 10), (2, 5), (6, 5), (12, 3), \
          (5, 3), (12, 1)]

   This is close but not quite right because the two points with y=5
   are out of order.

-  The trick is to sort by x first and then sort by y!

   ::

      >>> by_x = sorted(pts, reverse=True)
      >>> by_x
      [(14, 10), (12, 10), (12, 3), (12, 1), (8, 12), (6, 5), \
         (5, 3), (2, 5)]
      >>> sorted(by_x, key=lambda p: p[1], reverse=True)
      [(8, 12), (14, 10), (12, 10), (6, 5), (2, 5), (12, 3), \
         (5, 3), (12, 1)]

-  This works because :func:`sorted` uses what's known as a *stable
   sort*:  when two values are "tied" according to the
   sorting criteria (y value in the second sort) their relative
   ordering (by x value from the first sort) in the final list is preserved.

   -  Therefore, (6, 5) comes earlier than (2, 5), while (12, 3) comes
      earlier than (5, 3).

-  A number of variations on sorting use this "stable sort" property,
   but not all fast sorting algorithms are stable.

-  Of course, we can also extend our lambda to reverse the tuple provided to sort().

   ::

      >> sorted(pts, key=lambda p: (p[1], p[0]), reverse=True)
      [(8, 12), (14, 10), (12, 10), (6, 5), (2, 5), (12, 3), \
         (5, 3), (12, 1)]



Practice Problem
----------------

#. Use ``filter`` to eliminate all words that are shorter than 4
   letters from a list of words.


List Comprehensions
-------------------

- Instead of ``map`` and ``filter`` some people prefer another example
  of functional programming in Python called *list comprehensions*.

- Here is an example to generate a list of the squares of the first n integers:

  ::

    >>> n = 8
    >>> [i * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

- The form of this is an expression followed by a ``for`` loop
  statement.

- We can get the effect of ``filter`` by adding a conditional at the
  end:

  ::

    >>> v = [1, 9, -4, -8, 10, -3]
    >>> [x for x in v if x > 0]
    [1, 9, 10]

-  Here, the values are only generated in the resultant list when the
   ``if`` condition passes.

-  We can combine these as well.  As a slightly silly example, we can
   eliminate the negative values and square the positive values:

   ::

      >>> v = [1, 9, -4, -8, 10, -3]
      >>> [x * x for x in v if x > 0]
      [1, 81, 100]

-  We can get even more sophisticated by nesting ``for`` loops. Here is
   an example where we generate all pairs of numbers between 1 and 4,
   except for the pairs where the numbers are equal:

   ::

      >>> [(i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(1, 5) if i != j]
      [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2),
          (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)]

Exercises
---------

#. Write a list comprehension statement to generate a list of all
   pairs of odd positive integer values less than 10 where the first value is
   less than the second value.


Summary and Discussion
----------------------

-  We've explored programming that is more compact and at a higher
   level of abstraction. It can be used to effectively interact with
   data.

-  ``map`` and ``filter`` each take a function and a sequence (an
   "iterable") as arguments and produce an iterator as a result:

   - ``map`` produces the result of applying the function to each element
     of the iterable.

   - ``filter`` produces each element of the iterable for which the
     function returns ``True``.

-  Both ``map`` and ``filter`` are made more compact by using
   lambda functions.

-  Lambda functions can also be used to change the result of
   sorting.

-  A *stable sort* preserves the relative order of "tied" values.

-  *List comprehensions* can be used in place of ``map`` and
   ``filter``:

   - Some people prefer list comprehensions because they often do not
     require lambda functions, but...

   - List comprehensions explicitly construct the list of results rather than
     generating them one-by-one, which is what ``map`` and ``filter``
     do.  This makes them less efficient for large data sets.

- These are all examples of *functional programming*.

- We've also used other major programming paradigms this semester:

  - *imperative programming*

  - *object oriented programming*

- Many modern languages like Python provide tools that allow
  programming using a combination of paradigms.
