Lecture 6 — Decisions Part 1
============================


Initial Example:
----------------

-  Suppose we have a height measurements for two people, Chris and
   Sandy.  We have the tools to write a program that determines which
   height measurement is greater:

   ::

      chris_height = float(input("Enter Chris's height (in cm): "))
      sandy_height = float(input("Enter Sandy's height (in cm): "))
      print("The greater height is", max(chris_height, sandy_height))

-  But, we don't have the tools yet to *decide* who has the greater
   height.  For this we need *if statements*:

   ::

      chris_height = float(input("Enter Chris's height (in cm): "))
      sandy_height = float(input("Enter Sandy's height (in cm): "))
      if chris_height > sandy_height:
          print("Chris is taller")
      else:
          print("Sandy is taller")

-  This is the first of many lectures exploring logic, if statements,
   and decision making.
 

Overview — Logic and Decision Making
------------------------------------

-  Boolean logic

-  Use in decision making

-  Use in branching and alternatives

Reading: Chapter 5 of *Practical Programming*. We will not cover all
of this today, and will return
to the rest of this chapter later in the semester.


Part 1: Boolean Values
----------------------

-  Yet another type.

-  Values are only ``True`` and ``False``.

-  We’ll see a series of operations that either produce or use
   boolean values, including relational operators such as ``<``, ``<=``,
   etc. and logical operations such as ``and`` and ``or``.

-  We can assign them to variables, as in:

   ::

         x = True

   although we will not explore this much during the current lecture.


Relational Operators — Less Than and Greater Than
-------------------------------------------------

-  Comparisons between values, perhaps values associated with variables,
   to produce a boolean outcome.

-  For numerical values, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=`` are
   straightforward:

   ::

       >>> x = 17
       >>> y = 15.1
       >>> x < y
       False
       >>> x <= y
       False
       >>> x <= 17
       True
       >>> y < x
       True

-  The comparison operators ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``,
   ``>=`` may also be used for strings but the results are sometimes a
   bit surprising:

   ::

       >>> s1 = 'art'
       >>> s2 = 'Art'
       >>> s3 = 'Music'
       >>> s4 = 'music'
       >>> s1 < s2
       False
       >>> s2 < s3
       True
       >>> s2 < s4
       True
       >>> s1 < s3
       False

-  With strings, the ordering is what’s called *lexicographic* rather
   than purely alphabetical order:

   -  All capital letters come before small letters, so strict
      alphabetical ordering can only be ensured when there is no
      mixing of caps and smalls.

Relational Operators: Equality and Inequality
---------------------------------------------

-  Testing if two values are equal uses the combined, double-equal
   symbol ``==`` rather than the single ``=``, which is reserved for
   assignment.

   -  Getting accustomed to this convention requires practice, and it
      is a common source of mistakes.

-  Inequality is indicated by ``!=``.

-  We will play with a few examples in class.

Part 1 Exercises
----------------

We will stop here and give students a chance to work on the first
lecture exercise.



Part 2: if Statements
---------------------

-  General form of what we saw in the example we explored at the start
   of lecture:

   ::

       if condition:
          block1
       else:
          block2

   where:

   -  ``condition`` is the result of a logical expression (a boolean), such as the
      result of computing the value of a relational operation.

   -  ``block1`` is Python code executed when the condition is ``True``.

   -  ``block2`` is Python code executed when the condition is
      ``False``.

-  All statements in ``block1`` and ``block2`` must be indented the
   same number of spaces.

-  The ``block`` continues until the indentation stops, and returns to
   the same level of indentation as the statement starting with ``if``.

-  The ``else:`` and ``block2`` are optional, as the following example
   shows.

Example: Heights of Siblings
----------------------------

-  Here is a more extensive version of our initial example, implemented
   using two consecutive ``if`` statements and not using an ``else``:

   ::

       name1 = "Dale"
       print("Enter the height of", name1, "in cm ==> ", end='')
       height1 = int(input())

       name2 = "Erin"
       print("Enter the height of", name2, "in cm ==> ", end='')
       height2 = int(input())

       if height1 < height2:
           print(name2, "is taller")
           max_height = height2

       if height1 >= height2:
           print(name1, "is taller")
           max_height = height1

       print("The max height is", max_height)

-  Writing two separate ``if`` statements like this, while good as an
   illustration, is not a good idea in practice.  We need to read the
   code to understand that the two ``if`` statements produce mutually
   exclusive results.  Instead we should use ``else``:

   ::

       name1 = "Dale"
       height1 = int(input("Enter the height of " + name1 + " in cm ==> "))

       name2 = "Erin"
       height2 = int(input("Enter the height of " + name2 + " in cm ==> "))

       if height1 < height2:
           print(name2, "is taller")
           max_height = height2
       else:
           print(name1, "is taller")
           max_height = height1

       print("The max height is", max_height)

-  Notes:

   - The blank lines are added for clarity; they are not required
     for these programs to have correct syntax.

   - Neither program handles the case of Dale and Erin being the same
     height. For this we need the next Python construct.

Elif
----

Recall the kids guessing game where someone thinks of a number and you
have to guess it. The only information you are given is that the person
who knows the number tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or if
you got it correct.

-  When we have three or more alternatives to consider we use the
   if-elif-else structure:

   ::

       if condition1:
           block1
       elif condition2:
           block2
       else:
           block3

-  We’ll rewrite the height example to use ``elif`` to handle the case of Dale
   and Erin having the same height.

-  Notes:

   -  You do **NOT** need to have an ``else`` block.

   -  Exactly **one** block of code (block1, block2, block3) is
      executed!  Don't forget this!

   -  If we leave off the ``else:`` and block3, then it is possible that
      none of the blocks are executed.

   -  You can use multiple ``elif`` conditions and blocks.


Part 3: More Complex Boolean Expressions, Starting with and
-----------------------------------------------------------

Consider the following piece of Python code that outputs a message if
it was above freezing both yesterday and today:

   ::

      cel_today = 12
      cel_yesterday = -1
      if cel_today > 0 and cel_yesterday > 0:
          print("It was above freezing both yesterday and today.")

-  A boolean expression involving ``and`` is ``True`` if and only if
   **both** the relational operations produce the value ``True``.

More Complex Boolean Expressions — or
-------------------------------------

Consider the following:

   ::

      cel_today = 12
      cel_yesterday = -1
      if cel_today > 0 or cel_yesterday > 0:
          print("It has been above freezing in the last two days.")

-  The boolean expression is ``True`` if ANY of the following occurs:

   -  the left relational expression is ``True``,

   -  the right relational expression is ``True``,

   -  **both** the left and right relational expression are ``True``.

-  This is called the *inclusive or* and it is somewhat different from
   common use of the word *or* in English.

-  For examples, in the sentence:

       You may order the pancakes or the omelet.

   usually means you may choose pancakes, or you may choose an omelet,
   but you may not choose both (unless you pay extra).

   -  This is called the *exclusive-or*; it is only used in logic and
      computer science in very special cases.

   -  Hence, ``or`` always means *inclusive-or*.

Boolean Logic — not
-------------------

-  We can also “logically negate” a boolean expression using ``not``.

   ::

       a = 15
       b = 20
       if not a < b:
           print("a is not less than b")
       else:
           print("a is less than b")


Final Example - Is a Point Inside a Rectangle
---------------------------------------------

We'll gather all of ideas from class to solve the following example:
Suppose the bounds of a rectangle are defined by:

   ::

       x0 = 10
       x1 = 16
       y0 = 32
       y1 = 45

A point at location :math:`x,y` is inside the rectangle if:

   .. math:: x0 < x < x1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad y0 < y < y1.

Under what conditions are we outside of the rectangle? Under what
conditions are we on the boundary?

We will write a program that reads in an x, y coordinate of a point
and outputs a message depending on whether the point is inside the
rectangle, outside the rectangle, or on the boundary.  The final code
will be posted on the course Website.


Summary and Looking Ahead
-------------------------

-  if-else and if-elif-else are tools for making decisions and creating
   alternative computations and results.

-  The conditional tests involve relationship operators and logical
   operators.

   -  Be careful with the distinction between ``=`` and ``==``.

-  In Lecture 11 we will review boolean logic and discuss more complex ``if``
   structures.
