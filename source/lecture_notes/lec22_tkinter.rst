Overview of Today's Lecture
---------------------------

-  We will learn about event driven programming.

-  We will discuss graphical user interfaces (GUI).

-  We will see how to use the TkInter implementation for Python
   to develop GUIs.


Graphical User Interface
------------------------

-  All our programs so far had a terminal based input/output through
   Wing IDE 101. This is the simplest type of user interface: enter some text
   and get some output.

-  In real life, we rarely use such programs. All Web interfaces and
   mobile apps involve elements like buttons, text input fields, radio
   buttons, etc.

   This type of a user interface is called a **graphical user interface**
   or GUI.

-  Designing a GUI is not a simple matter. It requires one to
   understand effective communication of information through visual
   interfaces. It is highly recommend you take a class on Visual
   Communication or Human Computer Interaction to learn more about
   these.

-  Many GUI packages will have some default settings that are meant to
   help you design interfaces that are at least not awful! So, make sure
   you do not override them until you know what you are doing.


Event Driven Programming
------------------------

-  A graphical user interface is designed to do something in response
   to an event.

-  Example events are:

   -  Button push (most popular so far)
   -  Selection from a list of options
   -  Mouse movement

-  The interface usually runs within a main window (often called
   root) and listens continuously for events it knows how to process.

   -  Hence, a GUI is always in an infinite loop.

   -  When an event happens, it executes the function corresponding to
      the event and continues to listen.

   -  To finish the GUI loop, often an explicit termination command
      has to happen. 

-  TkInter is a Python module implementing the Tk toolkit for building
   graphical user interfaces. Other languages also have Tk
   implementations.

-  **Note:** The most important distinction between regular and event
   based programming is that the action corresponding to an event gets
   executed in parallel with the rest of the program, it does not
   block the execution of functions in response to other events.
   
   
TkInter First Program
---------------------

-  Let's see a very basic program.

   ::

      from tkinter import * ### (1)

      root = Tk()           ### (2)
      root.mainloop()       ### (3)
      print("Hello")        ### (4)
      
   #. It is common to import everything from Tkinter to make it
      easy to write GUI programs. Compare this with the following
      program that does the same exact thing but requires using
      Tkinter for all calls to the module.
      ::

	 import tkinter
	 root = tkinter.Tk()
	 root.mainloop()
	 print("Hello")

   #. We create the main window that the whole application will
      run in. This main window has many properties already: it can be
      resized and moved like any window on your computer.

   #. We tell the main window to run in an infinite loop, until it is
      explicitly terminated. In this case, you need to explicitly
      click on the upper left corner to close this application. This
      generates a "destroy" event, which terminates the main window.

   #. To understand the infinite loop notice that ``print("Hello")``
      command is not executed until the window terminates and the
      main loop ends.

Widgets and Containers
-----------------------

-  GUIs involve two main types of objects: widgets and containers

-  Widgets are objects that have a function and are visible. These
   are the main elements of an interface. We will see the following
   main widgets:

   -  Buttons: can do something when clicked
   -  Canvas: you can draw shapes or put shapes in them

-  There are many other widgets like radio boxes, check boxes, menus of
   items, etc. You can learn these after we get comfortable with these two.

-  Containers are invisible, but they allow us to group widgets and
   arrange them in visual groups. We will see only one type of container
   in this lecture:

   -  Frames: can contain any of the widgets of the above type

-  Containers' size will grow and shrink to fit the objects contained
   within. Containers can contain other containers as well.

Example use of containers and buttons
-------------------------------------

-  Let's create a first program to create four buttons, put the first
   pair in one frame, the second pair in another frame, and then
   arrange these two frames on top of each other.
   
   ::

      from tkinter import *
      
      root = Tk()
      main_frame = Frame(root)
      main_frame.pack()
      
      top_frame = Frame(main_frame)
      top_frame.pack(side=TOP)
      
      bottom_frame = Frame(main_frame)
      bottom_frame.pack(side=BOTTOM)
      
      button1 = Button(top_frame, text="Top 1")
      button1.pack(side=LEFT)
      button2 = Button(top_frame, text="Top 2")
      button2.pack(side=RIGHT)
      
      button3 = Button(bottom_frame, text="Bottom 1")
      button3.pack(side=LEFT)
      button4 = Button(bottom_frame, text="Bottom 2")
      button4.pack(side=RIGHT)
      
      root.mainloop()

-  In the above example, the two frames for containing buttons are
   organized inside another frame.

-  The organization between widgets is achieved by a strict hierarchy.
   Each widget or container has a parent:

   =============   =============
   GUI Element     Parent
   =============   =============
   root            None
   main_frame      root
   top_frame       main_frame
   bottom_frame    main_frame
   button1         top_frame
   button2         top_frame
   button3         bottom_frame
   button4         bottom_frame
   =============   =============

-  Whenever you create a frame, button, or canvas, the first argument is the
   parent element.

   - Parent element tells us the placement of the widget, e.g. ``button1`` is
     placed to the left of ``top_frame`` and ``top_frame`` is to the top of
     ``main_frame`` and ``main_frame`` is within the main window of ``root``.

   - Parent container's size is determined as a function of the sizes of
     its children. If nothing was put in a container, its size may be zero.

-  Pack will make the interface element a part of the GUI, creating them is not
   enough. You must attach them to the interface with packing.

-  By changing the arguments to :func:`pack` we can alter the
   placement of the buttons and the frames.
     
Running tkinter programs using classes
--------------------------------------

-  Already our programs are becoming long and so far they don't really
   do anything yet!  What we really want is to have programs
   accomplish tasks when a button is pressed (for example).

-  As it is generally tricky to pass variables between different
   Tkinter events, we often use classes to implement the main Tk
   applications.

   The member attributes will help us pass values between
   events.

-  We will first rewrite the above program using classes as shown
   below.
   
   ::

      from tkinter import *

      class MyApp(object):
          def __init__(self, parent):
              self.main_frame = Frame(parent)
              self.main_frame.pack()
              
              self.top_frame = Frame(self.main_frame)
              self.top_frame.pack(side=TOP)
              self.bottom_frame = Frame(self.main_frame)
              self.bottom_frame.pack(side=BOTTOM)
              
              self.button1 = Button(self.top_frame, text="Top 1")
              self.button1.pack(side=LEFT)
              self.button2 = Button(self.top_frame, text="Top 2")
              self.button2.pack(side=RIGHT)
              self.button3 = Button(self.bottom_frame, text="Bottom 1")
              self.button3.pack(side=LEFT)
              self.button4 = Button(self.bottom_frame, text="Bottom 2")
              self.button4.pack(side=RIGHT)
      
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          root = Tk()
          myapp = MyApp(root)
          root.mainloop()
      
-  This is the main idea: any object outside of root is defined within
   a class, using root as the parent.

-  We can now add functionality to this class that will modify the
   widgets.

Button Click
------------

-  You track many events in a GUI, but we will not see
   them (such as when a specific mouse button, left or right, is
   clicked, when it is released, when the cursor is moved, when
   something is typed on the keyboard, etc.)

   (Note the distinction between the
   widget that is the GUI button, and the physical button on your
   mouse.)

-  Command attribute of `Button` allows you to associate a function name
   with a button click (in GUI terms this is a combination of two
   events: left button click and its release).

   See the following example:

   ::

      self.button = Button(self.bottom_frame, text="Quit", command=self.terminate_program)

-  The button we generate in this example has a function binding: when it
   is clicked, it will call function :func:`self.terminate_program`.

Example Program with a Button Click
------------------------------------

- This simple program terminates the program by completely destroying the
  root window.

  ::

     from tkinter import *

     class MyApp(object):
         def __init__(self, parent):
             self.parent = parent
             self.main_frame = Frame(parent)
             self.main_frame.pack()
             self.button = Button(self.main_frame, text="Quit", command=self.terminate_program)
             self.button.configure(width=12, padx="4m", pady="4m")
             self.button.pack()
     
         def terminate_program(self):
             self.parent.destroy()
     
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         root = Tk()
         myapp = MyApp(root)
         root.mainloop()

-  Here we see the use of classes for two important functions:

   -  Keeping track of the root as the parent of all GUI elements.
   -  Defining a function that can access the parent object attached to `self` and destroy
      it by ending the application.

-  We also saw that you can control the size of the button by configuring its width. Padding
   on x and y allows us to control how the button is placed inside the frame.

Canvas Widget
--------------

- This is the last widget we will see today. Canvas is a blank area. You can continuously
  draw things in it or put text in it. Here are some basic operations.

- Create canvas:
  
  ::

     canvas = Canvas(parent, height=200, width=200)
     canvas.pack()

-  Draw something in a canvas (an oval within the given box coordinates):

   ::

      canvas.create_oval((40, 40, 80, 80))

-  Remember, like Image objects, (0, 0) represents the top left corner.

-  When you draw multiple things in a canvas, it may not immediately
   show what you draw and a small delay may be noticed. You can force
   the canvas to show you what you draw with:

   ::

      canvas.update()
   
-  You can also draw lines, rectangles, and text. See more on:

   http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm
      

Timing of GUI Events
--------------------

-  Remember, GUI events are triggered when you click a button (or other
   events you watch in more sophisticated systems).

-  They execute in parallel. If the processing of an event takes some
   time, it may overlap with another event.

-  Sometimes drawing events are too fast for the eye to see the progress.
   You can incorporate some delays to make this more pleasing to the eye.

   ::

      canvas.after(waittime)

   which will add a small delay `waittime` to the program.
      
-  Note that :func:`after` and :func:`update` functions apply to many other GUI elements.
   Mastering them will help you get the exact timing effect from your interface.
   
Final Program
------------------

-  Here is a final program to put together a lot of the things we learned. It
   features a private class method (:func:`new_button`) that is only accessible
   to the :func:`__init__` function. It shows how functions can be used to automate
   repetitive tasks.

   ::

      from tkinter import *

      class MyApp(object):
          def __init__(self, parent):
              ## This method is internal to the initializer method
              ## and is used for creating buttons. It shortens the program code
              def new_button(parent, cmd, buttontext, packlocation):
                  button = Button(parent, command=cmd)
                  button.configure(text=buttontext)
                  button.configure(width=button_width,
                        padx=button_padx, pady=button_pady)
                  button.pack(side=packlocation)
                  return button

              #------ constants for controlling layout ------
              button_width = 10
              button_padx = "2m"
              button_pady = "1m"
              buttons_frame_padx =  "3m"
              buttons_frame_pady =  "2m"
              buttons_frame_ipadx = "3m"
              buttons_frame_ipady = "1m"
              # -------------- end constants ----------------

              #---------variables for controlling the function-----
              self.canvas_dimension = 600 ##Canvas will be a square
              self.wait_time = 8
              self.repetitions = 2
              #----------end of variables--------------------------

              self.myParent = parent
              self.main_frame = Frame(parent)
              self.main_frame.pack()

              ## Two frames inside the main frame, one for the canvas
              ## on top and the second one for buttons in the bottom
              self.draw_frame = Frame(self.main_frame)
              self.draw_frame.pack(side=TOP)

              self.info_canvas = Canvas(self.draw_frame, height=20,
                                         width=self.canvas_dimension)
              self.info_canvas.pack(side=TOP)
              self.text_area = self.info_canvas.create_text(10, 10, anchor='nw')
              self.info_canvas.itemconfigure(self.text_area, text="#circles = {:d}".format(self.repetitions))

              self.main_canvas = Canvas(self.draw_frame, \
                                        height=self.canvas_dimension,
                                        width=self.canvas_dimension)
              self.main_canvas.pack()

              self.button_frame = Frame(self.main_frame)
              self.button_frame.pack(side=BOTTOM)

              self.draw_button = new_button(self.button_frame, self.draw, 'Draw', LEFT)
              self.clear_button = new_button(self.button_frame, self.clear, 'Clear', LEFT)
              self.increase_button = new_button(self.button_frame, self.increase, 'Increase', LEFT)
              self.reduce_button = new_button(self.button_frame, self.reduce, 'Reduce', LEFT)
              self.quit_button = new_button(self.button_frame, self.quit, 'Quit', RIGHT)

          def clear(self):
              self.main_canvas.delete("all")

          def reduce(self):
              if self.repetitions > 1:
                  self.repetitions //= 2
              self.put_info()

          def increase(self):
              if self.repetitions < 200:
                  self.repetitions *= 2
              self.put_info()

          def put_info(self):
              ## Change the text field in the canvas
              self.info_canvas.itemconfigure(self.text_area, text="#circles = {:d}".format(self.repetitions))

          def draw(self):
              boundary_offset = 2
              max_radius = (self.canvas_dimension - 2 * boundary_offset) // 2
              xc = self.canvas_dimension // 2 + boundary_offset
              r = max_radius / self.repetitions
              inc = r
              for i in range(self.repetitions):
                  self.main_canvas.create_oval((xc - r, xc - r, xc + r, xc + r))
                  r += inc
                  self.main_canvas.update() # Actually refresh the drawing on the canvas.
                  # Pause execution.  This allows the eye to catch up
                  self.main_canvas.after(self.wait_time)

          def quit(self):
              self.myParent.destroy()

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          root = Tk()
          root.title("Drawing a circle") ##Give a title to the program
          myapp = MyApp(root)
          root.mainloop()


Summary
--------

-  Graphical user interfaces are event driven. You need to write functions
   to initialize the interface and change the interface when events happen.

-  The most common events are button clicks, but many others are possible.

-  Most GUI elements are visible and are called widgets.

-  Widgets are placed in invisible containers like frames to group them together.

-  Many containers have built-in methods for placing multiple widgets in a way
   that is pleasing to the eye.

-  When building an interface, some of the challenges involve making the interface
   easy and intuitive to use. Many communications classes concentrate on these
   issues.
