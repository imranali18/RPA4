Lecture 9 â€” While Loops
===========================

Overview
--------

-  Loops are used to access and modify information stored in lists and
   are used to repeat computations many times.

-  We construct loops using logical conditions: ``while`` loops.

-  We will investigate single and multiple loops.

Reading:  Our coverage of loops is in a different order than that of
*Practical Programming*.  A direct reference for reading material is
Section 9.6.


Part 1: The Basics
------------------

-  Loops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. This is
   the basis for many sophisticated programming tasks.

-  We will see two ways to write loops: using ``while`` loops and ``for`` loops.

-  In Python, ``while`` loops are more general because you
   can always write a ``for`` loop using a ``while`` loop.

-  We will start with ``while`` loops first and then see how we can 
   simplify common tasks with ``for`` loops later.


Basics of While
---------------

-  Our first ``while`` loop just counts numbers from 1 to 9, and prints them:

   ::

       i = 1
       while i < 10:
           print(i)
           i += 1   ## if you forget this, your program will never end

-  General form of a ``while`` loop:

   ::

       block a
       while condition:
           block b
       block c

-  Steps:

   #. Evaluate any code before ``while`` (**block a**).

   #. Evaluate the ``while`` loop ``condition``:

      #. If it is ``True``, evaluate **block b**, and then repeat
         the evaluation of the condition.

      #. If it is ``False``, end the loop, and continue with the code
         after the loop (**block c**).

   In other words, the cycle of evaluating the condition followed by
   evaluating the block of code continues until the condition evaluates
   to ``False``.

-  An important issue that is sometimes easy to answer and sometimes
   very hard to answer is to know that your loop will always
   terminate.


Using Loops with Lists
-----------------------

-  Often, we use loops to repeat a specific operation on every element of
   a list.

-  We must be careful to create a number that will serve as the index
   of elements of a list. Valid values are: 0 up to (not including)
   the length of list:

   ::

        co2_levels = [(2001, 320.03), (2003, 322.16), (2004, 328.07),\
                      (2006, 323.91), (2008, 341.47), (2009, 348.92),\
                      (2010, 357.29), (2011, 363.77), (2012, 361.51),\
                      (2013, 382.47)]

        i = 0
        while i < len(co2_levels):
            print("Year", co2_levels[i][0], \
                  "CO2 levels:", co2_levels[i][1])
            i += 1

-  Let's make some errors to see what happens to the loop.


Part 1 Practice
---------------

#.  Write a while loop to count down from 10 to 1, printing the values
    of the loop counting variable ``i`` (it could be some other variable
    name as well).

#.  Modify your loop to print the values in the list ``co2_levels`` in
    reverse order. 

..  Chuck's note (2016-01-18:  I felt like this next step was too big
    a jump, so I removed it.

.. #.  Write a program to convert a string containing multiple
    (like mystr below) to a list of integers (like mylist below)
..    ::
        mystr = '1,2,4,4,5'
        mylist = [1, 2, 4, 4, 5]


Accumulation of values
----------------------

-  Often, we use loops to accumulate some type of information such as
   adding all the values in a list.

-  Let's change the loop to add numbers from 1 to 9:

   ::

       i = 1
       total = 0
       while i < 10:
           total += i
           i += 1
       print(total)

   (Of course you can and should do this with the :func:`sum`
   function, but guess what that actually does!)

-  Let's use a loop to add the numbers in a list:

   -  Now, we will use the numbers the loop generates to index a list.

   -  So, the loop must generate numbers from 0 to the length of the list:

   ::

        co2_levels = [(2001, 320.03), (2003, 322.16), (2004, 328.07),\
                      (2006, 323.91), (2008, 341.47), (2009, 348.92),\
                      (2010, 357.29), (2011, 363.77), (2012, 361.51),\
                      (2013, 382.47)]

        i=0
        total=0
        while i < len(co2_levels):
            total += co2_levels[i][1]
            i += 1

        print("Total co2_levels is", total)


-  Let's have a more interesting example. Be very careful not to use
   an incorrect index for the list.

   - Count the number of CO2 values in the list that are greater
     than 350.

   - Calculate and print the percentage change in each measurement year
     from the previous measurement year.

   - Determine the years in which the CO2 levels dropped compared to the
     previous measurement. Output just these years.


Part 2 Practice
---------------

#.  Suppose we wanted to print the first, third, fifth, etc. elements
    in a list. Write code to accomplish this:

    ::

        months=['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']


#.  Now, use a similar loop code to print a little evergreen tree:

    ::

               *    
              ***   
             *****  
            ******* 
           *********
              ***   
              ***   

#.  Try this later: change your loop to work for any size evergreen.


Loops that end on other conditions
----------------------------------

-  Here is a while loop to add the non-zero numbers that the user types
   in:

   ::

       total = 0
       end_found = False

       while not end_found:
           x = int(input("Enter an integer to add (0 to end) ==> "))
           if x == 0:
               end_found = True
           else:
               total += x

       print(total)

-  We will work through this loop by hand in class.


Multiple nested loops
---------------------

-  Loops and if statements can both be nested.
  
-  We've already seen this for if statements.

-  Here's an example where we print every pair of values in a list.

-  First solution:

   ::

      L = [2, 21, 12, 8, 5, 31]
      i = 0
      while i < len(L):
          j = 0
          while j < len(L):
              print(L[i], L[j])
              j += 1
          i += 1

-  This solution prints the values from the same pair of indices twice
   -  e.g., the pair 21, 12 is printed once when *i=1*, *j=2* and
   once when *i=2*, *j=1*.

-  How can we modify it so that we only print each pair once?
  
-  What has to change if we don't want to print when *i==j*?

-  Finally, we will modify the resulting loop to find the two closest
   values in the list.

Summary
-------

-  Loops are especially useful for iterating over a list, accessing its
   contents, and adding or counting the values from a list. This is
   done in the :func:`sum` and :func:`len` functions of Python.

-  Each loop has a stopping condition --- the boolean expression in
   the *while* statement.  The loop will end when the condition
   evaluates to *True*.

-  If the stopping condition is never reached, the loop will become
   "infinite".

-  Often a counter variable is used. It (a) is given an initial value
   before the loop starts, (b) is incremented (or decremented) once in
   each loop iteration, and (c) is used to stop the loop when it
   reaches the index of the end (or beginning) of the list.

-  We will demonstrate a simple way to write these common loops with a
   ``for`` loop in the next lecture.
