Lecture 24 --- Exercises
========================

Solutions to the problems below must be sent to Submitty for
automatic scoring. A separate file must be submitted for each problem.
Start with the files available from the Course Materials section on Submitty as
``lecture24_files.zip``. Solutions must be submitted by 09:59:59 am on Tuesday,
April 23. **Each problem requires that you write / modify exactly one
line of code!**

#. Modify the code in ``prob1.py`` to generate a new list where all
   values are replaced by their absolute values. You must use :func:`map`,
   but there is no need for a lambda function.

#. Modify the code in ``prob2.py`` to determine the minimum x value of
   all points that are in the first quadrant (x and y values both
   positive). This will require you to use :func:`map`, :func:`filter`, and
   :func:`min`. You can write this in a single line, but for clarity you
   are welcome to write it on two or three. Do not create a new
   list.

#. Modify the code in ``prob3.py`` to sort the points in a list by
   their distance from the origin (i.e., by the magnitude of the
   points). This will require use of a ``lambda`` function.

#. Modify the code in ``prob4.py`` to use a list comprehension
   statement to convert a list of Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius,
   while eliminating those that are below freezing.

**Congratulations:** You are finished with the CS 1 lecture exercises!!
