Lecture 19 --- Exercises
========================

Solutions to the problems below must be sent to Submitty for
automatic scoring.  A separate file must be submitted for each problem.
Solutions must be submitted by 09:59:59 am on Tuesday, April 2.


#. The ``Restaurant.py`` file you were provided along with Lecture 19
   includes the main code
   area with code to test functions that have not yet been written
   (see the methods with ``pass`` as their only statement). These
   are :func:`min_review`, :func:`max_review`, :func:`latitude`, and
   :func:`longitude`. Please implement these functions, test them, and
   submit the resulting ``Restaurant.py``.

#. Copy the code in ``lec19_restaurant_exercise.py`` into a file
   called ``lec19_american_in_troy.py``. Rewrite the main code in
   this new file to list the names of all restaurants in 
   *Troy* that have *American* in their category and that have an average
   rating of **more than** 3.0. The **only output** should be the alphabetical
   list of restaurant names, one per line of 
   output. The trick is that you are *not allowed to change* the
   ``Restaurant`` class at all. This will require that you
   access and use both one or two methods from ``Restaurant`` and some
   of its attributes directly. Upload your
   ``lec19_american_in_troy.py`` to Submitty when you are done.
   Submitty will use our ``Restaurant.py`` file to test.
